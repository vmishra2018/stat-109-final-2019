Medicare Home Health Agency (HHA) Provider Aggregate Report, CY 2016

### Introduction

“The Home Health Agency PUF presents summarized information on services provided to Medicare beneficiaries by home health agencies. It contains information on utilization, payment (Medicare payment and Medicare standardized payment), submitted charges, and demographic and chronic condition indicators organized by CMS Certification Number (6-digit provider identification number), Home Health Resource Group (HHRG), and state of service.”
Our dataset contains aggregated, annual payment claim information for Home Health Agencies (HHA), which provide services to Medicare recipients. 
It gives insight into non Low Utilization Payment Adjustment (LUPA) Claims by these agencies. A non LUPA claim occurs when more than 4 billable visits are provided to a patient within a 60-day medical episode. 

The fact that these claims are non LUPA claims is important because the Medicare reimbursement on these claims is not determined by a national, standardized per visit rate, it is instead calculated using patient characteristics and doesn’t necessarily increase based on the number of billable visits for that specific medical episode.

The Medicare reimbursement for these claims is calculated by first completing an Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for each patient and running it through the Home Health Groupings Model. The result of this assessment groups episodes into one of 153 Home Health Resource Groups (HHRGs).  The derived HHRG is then used by Medicare to calculate the reimbursement amount for that episode.

Our data does not contain information at the patient level, but instead provides us insight at the Home Health Agency level. It gives us insight into the businesses of HHA’s in the United States and shows us their interactions with the federal Medicare system.
