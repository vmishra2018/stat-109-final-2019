### Motivation 

In 2017, U.S. health care costs In the United States reached an all time high of $3.5 trillion dollars. 

Health care was/is one of the country’s largest industries and as a share of the nation's Gross Domestic Product, healthcare spending accounted for 17.9 percent. If these numbers are broken down on a per person scale that equates to $10,739 spent on healthcare per person 

To put these numbers into perspective, in 1960, health care accounted for only 5 percent of Gross Domestic Product, totaling $27.2 billion dollars.

With healthcare being both a critical issue in the life of every American, and a major topic in the upcoming presidential election, we chose to do our analysis on a health care related dataset.  After taking a look into various data sources we chose one that allowed us to explore the federal health insurance program Medicare.

We chose a data set from Data.CMS.gov, a federal government website managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

### Problem Statement:

In this project, the goal is to Analyze the data set obtained from federal government and try to regress the amount paid with multiple features in the given dataset.

1. The first step would be clean the data and divide it in test and train data for our analysis.

2. The next step is to plot the data in various ways to try and get and understanding of trends in our data. This might also help us selecting our features.

3. After that we will now run some tests like  multi collinearity, normality etc to observe our feature variables.

4. Now our model building starts and we will use multiple models, compare residuals , run transformations where required.

5. Test our final model with test data and compute R squared value.
